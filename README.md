# Sorting-Algorithm-Comparison
<p>C program comparing time-complexity and stability of different sorting algorithms(bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort)</p>
<p>Upon running code, the program sorts random strings using different sorting algorithms and writes each of them to output files.</p>
